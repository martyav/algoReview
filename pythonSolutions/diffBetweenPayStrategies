# Given a certain amount to pay all hires, find the difference between the number of people you can hire
# if you pay each of your employees the most or the least amount possible.
#
# 1. You will always have at least one employee, who will be paid one dollar.
# 2. The next hire up must never be paid more than double their immediate subordinate.
# 3. The next hire up must never make less than the sum of their two immediate subordinates.
# 4. You must keep hiring until your next hire's pay matches or exceeds the total money you have left
#    to pay them
#
# Note that, if you have two employees, the second will always be paid either the same as the first
# (0 + 1) or exactly double the first (2 * 1)
