These are solutions to coding challenges that I have completed since 2016. 

Many of the Swift challenges are from my time as a student at [Coalition for Queens](https://www.c4q.nyc/). Most of the others are from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) or [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/java).

The Swift directory is the largest one at this time (February 2018). The next largest is Java, then Python. 

I have a project converting Java Coding Bat problems to Swift [here](https://github.com/martyav/swiftyCodingBat).
