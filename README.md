These are solutions to coding challenges that I have completed since 2016. 

Many of the Swift challenges are from my time as a student at Coalition for Queens. Most of the others are from HackerRank or CodingBat.

The Swift directory is the largest one at this time (January 2018). After that are Java, and, finally, Ruby. 

As someone trained in iOS, I am naturally most inclined to write Swift code -- sorry, Objective-C! I'm learning Java to get into Android and also to take advantage of the many comp-sci learning resources which are only available in Java. While Ruby is a fine language, I've been putting it to the side for now.

I also have previous experience with Javascript and Python, but I learned those two before I joined Github and haven't used them much since I started doing mobile development. That's why they are scarce here.
