# CodingBat for Swift

[CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/about.html) is a website containing practice problems for Python and Java. The problems teach basic syntax and beyond, but there is no current implementation for Swift. This folder contains practice problems re-written for Swift 4.

## Update (Dec 2017)

From now on, all work towards re-writing solutions in Swift will be placed in the [SwiftyCodingBat](https://github.com/martyav/swiftyCodingBat) repo. It is a full project bundle, containing unit tests, which can be run via XCode.
