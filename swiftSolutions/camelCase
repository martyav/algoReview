/* 
Alice wrote a sequence of words in CamelCase -- a string having the following properties:

* It is a concatenation of one or more words consisting of English letters.
* All letters in the first word are lowercase.
* For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is uppercase and rest of the letters are lowercase.

Given a string, print the number of words in the string on a new line.

let input = readLine()!

// Enter your code here 

func camelCase(_ text: String) -> Int {
    let array = text.components(separatedBy: CharacterSet.uppercaseLetters)
    
    return array.count
}

print(camelCase(input))

// Fun fact: CharacterSet.uppercaseLetters is not the same as CharacterSet.capitalizedLetters
// Thanks, Swift!
